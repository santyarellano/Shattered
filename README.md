## About the game
###### 2D, Platformer  
 After a devastating breakup, NN’s heart wasn’t the only thing shattered to pieces, as pain clouded his mind and spread through his trembling body, so intensely that he lost consciousness. Now, he must embark in an adventure to heal, move on, and find his broken parts, but most importantly, find himself.
